# Danske Bank

A simple internet banking application using React.

## Getting Started

Open a terminal / command prompt and run the ``` setup.sh ``` file to install node packages.

The above installs the node dependencies for the main package.json file, along
with dependencies for the API and UI projects.

Start the application:

``` npm start ```

The above will start the UI on port 3000 and start the API on port 3001.
